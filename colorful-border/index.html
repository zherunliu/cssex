      I wandered lonely as a cloud<br />
      That floats on high o'er vales and hills,<br />
      When all at once I saw a crowd,<br />
      A host, of golden daffodils;<br />
      Beside the lake,<br />
      beneath the trees,<br />
      Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.<br />
      Continuous as the stars that shine.<br />
      And twinkle on the milky way,<br />
      They stretched in never-ending line Along the margin of a bay:<br />
      Ten thousand saw I at a glance,<br />
      Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.<br />
